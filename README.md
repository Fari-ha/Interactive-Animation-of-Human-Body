# Interactive Animation of Human Body

This is a basic C++ OpenGL human body animation graphics project. This project shows how to simulate the intricate organ systems that make up the human body. This project primarily focuses on the functioning of the digestive and respiratory systems. This project intends to simplify the human body and its intricate internal systems to kids by using computer graphics. 

# Features

Realistic model of the human body.

Interactive controls to choose between two simulations to watch.  

An animation describing the functions of the organs.

Dynamic rendering of illustrations with OpenGL.

# Materials needed 

C++ compiler
Open Gl library 

# Implementation 

Make a clone of the repository.

Utilizing your C++ compiler, compile the code.

Launch the program.

# Reminder

You can update the project if you'd like by adding an animation to explain how other organs function or by making it so that organs can be moved and will display an error if they are placed incorrectly. There are numerous ways to increase the dynamic quality of this animation. 

Thank You ^-^
